# Arcade Sprint — Pure HTML5 Game (fresh project)

This repository is a brand-new HTML5 game project created from zero, with no relation to previous projects.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page with canvas game and local leaderboard UI.
- `css/style.css` — styles for layout and UI.
- `js/game.js` — complete game logic (controls, physics, obstacles, leaderboard).
- `assets/` — place assets here.
- `README.md` — this file.

## How to use
1. Upload all files to your web hosting (public directory).
2. Open `index.html` in browser.
3. Click Start or press Space to play.
4. Submit scores in the Local Leaderboard or during Game Over prompt.

## Next steps (suggestions)
- Add images/sprites in `assets/sprites` and update draw code to use them.
- Add sound effects (audio) and background music.
- Create multiple levels, power-ups, or different game modes.
- Integrate server-side leaderboard if you want persistent global scores.
